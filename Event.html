                    <h5 class="tab-text">Civil Engineering Association (CEA) is one of the largest students run organisations in India which is an amalgamation of students, scholars and faculty of Civil Engineering department, IIT Madras. Formed with the primary aim of exposing
                        potential civil engineers to the challenges of the profession, CEA actively encourages the future engineers to celebrate the "joy of engineering". The association conducts workshops, professional events, sports events, along with
                        social campaigns and lectures by great personalities to enhance the all-round development of students throughout the year. Along with the yearlong activities, CEA hosts annually a 3-day long CEA Fest which is a culmination of engineering
                        competitions and workshops, serving as a launching platform for budding civil engineers from all over India.</h5>

                                    participants to create a three-dimensional structure with the materials provided
                                    within a given time.</span> <span class="lead , work " style="font-size: small;">This event provides a perfect competitive platform for all
                                    those who have an unexplained passion for building structures. Prerequisites
                                    required are basic knowledge of civil engineering especially structural engineering.
                                    The winners will be decided based on load bearing capacity, and aesthetics of the
                                    model made with the effective use of materials provided.Project X is the similar
                                    version of Modeling, but will be conducted during the semester time.
